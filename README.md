# Implementation Summary
The following four features are implemented for Insight Data Science challenge 2017.

### Feature 1: 
List the top 10 most active host/IP addresses that have accessed the site.
If any two hosts have same frequency, the host that have earlier 'first-time' access to server will rank first.

### Feature 2: 
Identify the 10 resources that consume the most bandwidth on the site
If any two resources consume same bandwidth, the resources that have earlier 'first-time' access by host will rank first.

### Feature 3:
List the top 10 busiest (or most frequently visited) 60-minute periods 
If any two windows have same number of visits, the window that starts earlier will rank first.

### Feature 4: 
Detect patterns of three failed login attempts from the same IP address over 20 seconds so that all further attempts to the site can be blocked for 5 minutes. Log those possible security breaches.
